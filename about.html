            <h1>What is Motor Neurone Disease (MND)?</h1>
            <p>Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurological condition. 
                It affects a particular group of nerves in the brain and spinal cord
                 named motor neurons. As a result, the messages from the brain telling
                  the muscles to move gradually stop working, which leads to muscle 
                  wasting and weakness. This means that MND can affect how you 
                  walk, talk, eat, drink, and breathe. Other names for MND are Lou Gehrigâ€™s
                   disease, amotrophic lateral scleroisis or ALS.

            <h1>What Causes MND?</h1>
            <p>The cause or causes of MND are currently unknown. It is thought that there
                 may be environmental factors that trigger it in people who are susceptible
                  to the disease. Further high-quality research is needed to find out the
                   nature of these factors, and what makes a person more susceptible than
                    another. MND can affect people of all ages and unfortunately there is 
                    no cure, however symptoms can be managed to help the person achieve the 
                    best possible quality of life.

            <h1>How Common is MND?</h1>
            <p>In the UK there are over 5,000 adults living with MND at one time. In 
                Ireland the number living with MND currently is over 400. The risk of 
                getting MND across the lifetime is 1 in 300 people. It can affect adults 
                of any age, but is more likely to affect people over the age of 50. 
                Around 1 in 30,000 develops MND each year. In Ireland, this results in 
                around 150 new diagnosis every year.

            <h1>How is MND diagnosed?</h1>
            <p>Usually, a Neurologist will diagnose MND on the basis of the history and 
                signs. Early signs of MND may cause some initial difficulty in diagnosis 
                and as a result initial diagnosis can be unclear. There is no specific 
                laboratory test to diagnose MND which makes early diagnosis more challenging. 
                Sometimes imaging of the brain and spine in the form of an MRI, are necessary 
                to exclude other diseases. Other tests may include nerve conduction studies, 
                lumbar puncture, and muscle biopsy.

            <h1>How is MND Treated?</h1>
            <p>Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for MND. However, a lot can be 
                done to ease symptoms, optimise quality of life, and keep you as 
                mobile as possible for as long as possible. MND affects people in different 
                ways and many health professionals are often required to assist including a; Speech & Language Therapist, 
                Dietician, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, Social Worker, 
                Public Health Nurse, and Palliative Care Services/ Hospice.
