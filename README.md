# User Experience (UX)

## Goal of the Project

* The webpage should have a clear attractive design, and appear welcoming and professional.
* Display to the user the key information on the homepage, which encapsulates what the site is about.
* Provide contact information, clearly displayed on the home page.
* Provide contact information, clearly displayed on the home page.
* Offer users the opportunity to donate to the organisation, which will allow maintenance and provision of a quality service.

## User Stories:

* As a website user, I need to be able to be able to navigate through the pages easily.
* As a website user, I do not wish to be overwhelmed with information, I would like to see the key information, quickly and easily.
* As a website user, I want to be able to contact the service easily including email, phone, and by social media.

## Website Design - Color Scheme:

![Complementary colors image](assets/readme-files/complement-colors.png)

![Analogous colors image](assets/readme-files/analogous-colors.png)

![Monochromatic colors image](assets/readme-files/monochromatic-colors.png)


* The colors chosen were based around the MNDI logo image, which is a light orange colour. The logo was designed using [Adobe Express](https://express.adobe.com/express-apps/logo-maker/). The logo was designed in a number of different colors and styles. The colors were tested on the website, however it was difficult to match some colors to others. It was found that the orange had more complementary colors which could be matched, producing a more attractive color scheme.

![MNDI logo image](assets/readme-files/mndi-logo.png)

* A website called [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com) was used to identify the logo color. The website then suggests colors that are complementary to this. Colors were then chosen and the color codes were copied into the website CSS code.

![Color picker image](assets/readme-files/color-picker.png)

## Website Design - Fonts:

* Lato was chosen for the body text. It was chosen as it is a clear, precise, and professional looking font.

* Roboto was chosen for h1 and h2 headings. Roboto was chosen for its strong clean lines, and the friendly welcoming style for a website such as a charity website. It is known to pair well with Lato.


## Site layout:

* The site layout was designed by hand sketching. It shows placement of the different elements within the page. A sample sketch of the index.html page is shown below.

# Testing

## Testing User Stories: 

* As a website user I want to be be able to easily navigate the site, and learn more about Motor Neurone Disease and the resources available to me.

    * The website is clearly laid out with clearly color coded text boxes with icons sign-posting the user to the relevant content.

    * The navigation bar is clearly shown at the top of each page and is large and clear to read.

* As a patient or carer I want to know how I can contact you to find out more information.

    * The index page clearly has the contact information shown in a text box.

    * The footer section contains the business address as well as social media links to the organisation.

* As a carer or person intersted in helping those with MND I would like to donate to the cause.

    * The donate form allows the user to easily donate an amount of money of their choice.

    * I would like to stay informed of future pland and updates regarding MND research and plans of MNDI.

    * The form contains an option to sign up to a newsletter.




## Code Validation:

* The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) websites were used to validate all the HTML pages and the CSS style sheet for this project.

* The W3C Markup Validator found an error on the header for all three index.html, about.html, and donate.html pages. This error related to a button element being enclosed within an anchor element which is not allowed. The element, button must not appear as a descendant of the anchor element. As an alternative an id selector targeting the css code instead of the button element selector was used as a replacement.

* The W3C CSS Validator found an error relating to padding of the fieldset within the form page. A comma had been added between the padding values, which means it didn’t work. When this was fixed, it was decided the padding was not required, thus the padding was removed from the fieldset. No other errors were found.


## Accessibility:

* Lighthouse was used within Chrome Developer Tools to assess the performance and accessibility of the website across mobile and desktop devices.

* The lighthouse reports shown below show that all areas acheived a good accessibility score of 97%. The webite could have beeen improved on scores for performance for the index page on both desktop and tablet. The donate page could have improved performance on mobile devices. Given more time I would have fixed these issues using the reports and suggestions made by lighthouse.

## Testing Using Specific Tools:

* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) 
As previously explained above, Chrome dev tools was used throughout the whole process of website development to check how different elements of code worked together and to assist in trouble shooting. It was also more heavily used in testing responsiveness of the website.

* [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
Am I rsponsive was used to check responsiveness of the website on a number of device screen sizes at once.


## Manual Testing:

### Browser Compatibility:

The website has been tested on the following browsers:

* Safari:

    *  No issues regarding appearance, functionality or responsiveness.

*  Google Chrome:

    * No issues regarding appearance, functionality or responsiveness.

* Mozilla Firefox:

    *  No issues regarding appearance, functionality or responsiveness.

    * Toshiba Satellite L755-13J

    * iPhone 12 mini

    * iPhone 13 ProMax

    * OnePlus 6T

* Manual Tests Completed for Common Clickable Elements:

* Header and Footer
    * Tested across all three pages. 
        * Clicking the header logo, and header text will bring the user to the home page (index.html).
        * Clicking each of the nav bar links will bring the user to the appropriate website page.
        * Hovering over links in the nav bar will highlight the clickable link using an underline and alternate color.

    * Donate Page
        * When filling out the donate form the user is required to complete certain fields before submitting. First name, last name, and email are required in order for the form to be submitted. Need to change form so one donation amount can be selected. Ran out of time on the project, but given more time I would have styled the form so that one of the oprions must be selected but not both.
        * Hovering over the input boxes changes the border color to the orange form theme color, highlighting the input box to the user.
        * Hovering over the submit button will change the color and font of the button to match the same style used for the donate link button in the nav bar.
